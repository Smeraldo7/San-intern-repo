# Security Measures I Currently Follow:

- I enable 2FA on critical accounts like email, banking, and work-related accounts.
- I make sure my operating system, applications, and antivirus software are up to date.
- I use a VPN (one offered by my uni) when accessing sensitive information on public or unsecured networks.
- I lock my devices when stepping away to prevent unauthorized access.
  Areas for Improvement:I could use a password manager to generate and store complex, unique passwords.

# Making Secure Behavior a Habit:

- scheduling regular times to review and update passwords, security settings, and software.
  -Before accessing important accounts or sharing sensitive info,consciously checking for signs of phishing or malicious links.

# Steps to Ensure Passwords and Accounts Are Secure:

- Ensure all passwords are securely stored and unique for each account.
- Change passwords every 3–6 months, especially for sensitive accounts.
- Enable two-factor authentication for all major accounts and applications.
- Not reusing passwords across different platforms or accounts.

# What to Do if I Suspect a Security Breach or Suspicious Activity:

- If I suspect an account is compromised, I’ll change the password and enable 2FA if not already in use.
- Look for any unusual logins or actions, and report them to the relevant service provider.
- If it’s work-related, I would inform the team so they can investigate and take necessary actions.
- If my email or social media account is compromised, I would inform my contacts to prevent further phishing or spam attempts.
