# When to Use AI VS Own Skills:

Using AI when:

- I need quick syntax corrections or code suggestions.
- I'm stuck on a problem and need debugging assistance.
- I might need help generating boilerplate code or repetitive tasks.
- I'm exploring new frameworks or best practices.

Rely on own skills when:

- I need to deeply understand the logic behind a solution.
- Security, performance, and maintainability are top concerns.
- AI suggestions seem questionable or introduce technical debt.
- I'm working on proprietary or sensitive code.

# Avoiding Over-Reliance on AI While Benefiting From It:

- Treating AI as a tool, not a replacement for critical thinking.
- Always reviewing, testing and modifying AI-generated code.
- Continue learning core front-end principles (JS, React, security).

# Ensuring Data Privacy When Using AI Tools:

- Avoiding pasting sensitive company or user data into AI prompts.
- Following company policies on AI tool usage.
- Reviewing AI privacy policies to understand data handling practices.
- Using obfuscation techniques (like replacing real data with placeholders) when necessary.

# Best Practice for Using AI at Focus Bear:

Always reviewing, testing, and validating AI-generated code before integrating it into production to ensure security, performance, and maintainability.

# Example usage of AI:
I got help from AI in troubleshooting an error I got while configuring a power automate flow. This is the screenshot of that error and ChatGPT's assistance:

The flow ran successfully after I applied those changes.
