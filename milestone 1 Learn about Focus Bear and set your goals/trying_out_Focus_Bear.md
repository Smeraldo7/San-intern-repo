# first impression of the app:

I was impressed by how well it is designed, with a smooth flow into the whole, new user set up (taking into account the distracting sites, providing videos on how things work, adding goals and times for habits etc)

# Did you find anything difficult to understand:

No, I found it pretty easy to understand.

# If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?

A cool app to help people stay focused and get their daily stuff done!

# What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?

- Making users able to add their own workout videos (ability to change some embedded videos)
- Using a lighter shade of a color instead of white for the background
