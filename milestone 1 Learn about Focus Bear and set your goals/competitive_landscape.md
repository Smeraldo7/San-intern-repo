# What makes Focus Bear different from these apps (Freedom, Cold Turkey,Tiimo,Routinery)?

Focus Bear is like the best of all worlds—it brings together the most useful features from these apps in one place. It blocks distractions automatically, has Pomodoro mode, customizable block and allow lists, and works smoothly across all our devices. It can tell if a site aligns with our focus goals and even give us little AI-powered pep talks to keep us on track with our habits, which I find fun.

# If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

I would choose focus bear over its competitiors because I feel like focus bear has pretty much all the features offered by those apps including creating habits, routines, scheduling certain habits to specific days, blocklists,allowlists. One feature that I found appealing about focus bear is the 'Habit packs' offered, where we could follow routines of famous figures with productive lifestyles.

# What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

Cold turkey has the ability to block the entire computer (lock, log off or shutdown) to schedule time away from it.
Freedom can block the internet. Tiimo has an AI planner which turns our thoughts into a structured actionable plan, automatically generating tasks.

# Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

I feel like the appearance could be improved to make it a bit more appealing.(like adding a bit more animations like confetti when a task or focus session is completed)
