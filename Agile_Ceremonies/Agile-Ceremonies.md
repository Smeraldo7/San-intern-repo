# Agile Ceremonies Reflection

## How Agile Ceremonies Help with Communication and Alignment

-Help create structured opportunities for the team to communicate, align on goals, and address challenges.

- Daily Stand-ups ensure team members stay updated on progress and blockers.
- Retrospectives promote continuous improvement by reflecting on past work and identifying areas for growth.
- Backlog Refinement keeps priorities clear and prevents last-minute surprises.

## Most Important Ceremony for My Role

- **Daily Stand-ups** are the most important for me as a front-end developer because:
  - They provide real-time updates on UI-related work and dependencies.
  - I can raise blockers related to API readiness, design inconsistencies, or third-party integrations.
