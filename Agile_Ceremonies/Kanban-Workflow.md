# How Kanban Helps Manage Priorities and Avoid Overload

## Managing Priorities:
- Everythingâ€™s on the board, making it easy to see and prioritize what needs attention.
- **Pull system**: Team members can grab tasks based on availability, so high-priority work gets done first.
- **WIP limits**: Limiting how many tasks are in progress keeps things focused and prevents overload.

## Avoiding Overload:
- **WIP limits**: we can set limits on each stage to avoid taking on too much work.
- Full columns highlight issues, so that we can fix problems before things pile up.
- Tasks move smoothly through stages, preventing bottlenecks and delays.

# How to improve workflow using Kanban principles:
- **Visualizing**: Tracking tasks from backlog to done.
- **Limiting WIP**: to prevent overload by setting max limits for each stage.
- **Focusing on flow**: to keep tasks moving quickly by removing bottlenecks.
- **Prioritizing**: Highlighting high-priority tasks to get them done first.
- **Reviewing regularly**: Continuously improving the process for better efficiency.
