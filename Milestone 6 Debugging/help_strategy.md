# When you get stuck - what next?

## When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?

- When it’s a multi-step process and I want the steps summarized or walked through (e.g. setting up a dev environment).

- When I need quick code snippets or examples without clicking into 10 different forum posts.

- When I want a customized explanation (e.g. “explain this like I’m new to React”).

- When I’m working on something conceptual, like understanding state management patterns or a library’s design philosophy.

I prefer Google when:

- I need official documentation or changelogs.
- I’m troubleshooting very specific errors (e.g. Stack Overflow posts).
- I want to compare multiple solutions quickly from different sources.
- I’m dealing with a tool or framework that changes rapidly, where AI answers may be outdated

## How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

- When I’ve already tried AI and Google, but the solution is still unclear or not working (e.g., deprecated AI suggestions like in the Husky install).

- When the problem involves internal tools, workflows, or project-specific constraints.

- When there’s time pressure, and I need a quick answer from someone who understands the context.

- If the issue involves proprietary code or sensitive client info, and it’s not safe to share externally.

- When the problem might impact others (e.g., shared codebase or production environment), and I want to collaborate on the safest fix.

## What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

- Information overload: Too many results, outdated answers, or conflicting solutions online.

- Lack of context: Forums and AI don’t always know our exact setup, dependencies, or constraints.

- Bias toward the wrong solution (It’s easy to tunnel vision on a theory that’s incorrect).

- Confidence issues: Doubting whether their approach is correct without peer validation.

- Debugging fatigue: Troubleshooting solo can be draining, especially with vague or intermittent bugs.

- AI might suggest answers that look right but subtly break things.

- Some fixes are just known by experienced teammates and not documented anywhere.
