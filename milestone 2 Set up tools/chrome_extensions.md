# Which extensions did you install? Why?

I installed,
- React Developer Tools : To inspect and debug React components efficiently
- Redux DevTools (debug Redux state): To debug and track changes in the redux state
- A JSON Viewer: To pretty-print API responses for better readability
- Lighthouse (performance auditing for web apps): To audit web app performance, accessibility and SEO.

# What was the most useful thing you learned?

I learned about the Profiler tab in React DevTools. It helps track component render times and find unnecessary re-renders. This makes it easier to spot performance issues and optimize components using React.memo(), useMemo(), and useCallback().
