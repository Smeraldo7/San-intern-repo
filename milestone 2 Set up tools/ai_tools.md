# AI Tools

## Which AI tools did you try?
- GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT

## What worked well? What didn’t?
I found GitHub copilot to be quite helpful in finding and fixing syntax errors. It also helped with converting styles from JS to CSS when moving parts to a separate CSS file.But sometimes, it suggested a fix that wasn’t exactly what I needed, and I had to manually adjust it.

chatGPT is very helpful when learning about new things, for example, I was learning about the 'Profiler' under ReactDev tools by following a video tutorial and using the profiler, ChatGPT helped me understand more stuff like the Layout Effects & Passive Effects, which weren't mentioned in the tutorial I was following.

## When do you think AI is most useful for coding?
- When some codes are depracated, AI helps refactor and update the code by replacing outdated syntax.
- Useful in detecting bugs and vulnerabilities in large codebases and suggesting fixes.
- when it helps with code completions and snippets.
- When it helps in learning new technologies by providing examples and guidance.
